\usage{
fracPlot(
  data,
  protein_column = "Accession",
  fraction_column = "Fraction_Number",
  color_column,
  list_of_proteins,
  fraction_position = "x",
  mark_size = 2,
  mark_shape = 18,
  protein_labels_size,
  fraction_labels_size,
  protein_name = "Protein",
  fraction_name = "Fraction number",
  color_name = color_column,
  order_proteins = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame with all proteins from all fractions listed in rows and with two required columns, "protein_column" and "fraction_column".}

\item{protein_column}{Column used to identify the proteins. Default value is "Accession".}

\item{fraction_column}{Column used to identify the fraction number. Default value is "Fraction_Number".}

\item{color_column}{Column used to color the points of scatter plot. If it is missing, the plot will be in black.}

\item{list_of_proteins}{List of proteins we want to plot. In case we want to plot only a subset of all proteins. If it is missing,
all proteins in "data" are plotted.}

\item{fraction_position}{Orientation of the plot. For "x", fractions are plotted on x-axis. For "y", fractions are plotted on y-axis.
Deafult is "x".}

\item{mark_size}{Size of point. Passed to "ggplot2". Defaults to 2.}

\item{mark_shape}{Shape of points. Passed to "ggplot2". Defaults to 18, a diamond shape.}

\item{protein_labels_size}{Size of axis labels for proteins. If missing, it is set automatically.}

\item{fraction_labels_size}{Size of axis labels for fractions. If missing, it is set automatically.}

\item{protein_name}{Name of axis. Default values is "Protein".}

\item{fraction_name}{Name of axis. Default values is "Fraction number"}

\item{color_name}{Name of color legend. By default, it is equal to "color_column"}

\item{order_proteins}{Whether to preserve the given order of the proteins from the "list_of_proteins".
If TRUE, proteins are ordered alphabetically based on the "protein_column".
If FALSE, the order of the list is preserved. Defaults to TRUE.}
}
\value{
Returns "ggplot2" object, the scatter plot in which every point represents a protein found in a fraction. Points can be
colored based on the values of "color_column" with the color scale shown in the legend. The plot can easily be saved using "ggsave" function.
}
\description{
Scatter plot based on a data frame. Data frame gives the list of proteins found in fractions. Points
can additionally be colored based on the values of one of the given columns.
