## visProteomics

**visProteomics** helps with the exploration and visualization of
proteomics data obtained with the process of fractionation.
Fractionation of samples is often used in proteomics to improve
signal-to-noise ratio and proteome coverage. **visProteomics** explores
attributes of proteins detected in different fractions through both
plotting and tabular representation.

Venn/Euler diagrams are widely used for data summarization and there are
many plotting tools available. **visProteomics** defines a complementary
tabular function to these plots. Resulting data frame summarizes
attributes of elements found in different regions of Venn diagram. This
generic function can be used for any data set.
